### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a computer security engineer, with a focus on blockchain and smart contract development.

My notes are available on my website [Access Denied](https://rya-sge.github.io/access-denied/). It covers various topics such as blockchain, cryptography, programming, networking, and so on.

I also have a twitter account to monitor attacks on the Blockchain ecosystem ([https://twitter.com/ADCDIII](https://twitter.com/ADCDIII))

I hope you can find your happiness among this content. If you have any questions, it is possible to contact me on my [Linkedin](https://ch.linkedin.com/in/ryan-sauge/en?trk=public_profile_locale-url).

Before jumping on the crypto wagon, I have participated in my free time in Capture The Flags (CTFs) and solved challenges on [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/p/Carcajou) and [Root Me](https://www.root-me.org).
